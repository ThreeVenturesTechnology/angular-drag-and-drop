# DragAndDrop
**Demo**: https://threeventures.com/demo/angular/drag-and-drop/

----

## Implementation Details
There are really three key parts to this repository:
1. /src/app/drag.service.ts
2. /src/app/draggable.directive.ts
3. /src/app/droppable.directive.ts


The service is a means of communication between two directives (draggable and droppable). Draggable directive is self defined, as is droppable.

See the blog post at https://threeventures.com/blog/ for more details
